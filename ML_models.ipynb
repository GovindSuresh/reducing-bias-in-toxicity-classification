    "The goal for our work is to not only train a model to identify toxic comments, but to do so while reducing bias.\n",
    "Bias in this task can be viewed as the situation where certain identies such as 'Black', 'Muslim', 'Gay' e.t.c, begin triggering toxic classification for comments they are in, even when the comment is actually positive. This is a key issue in toxic comment classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the [jigsaw unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data) Kaggle challenge was to reduce this bias via a newly developed submetric which we have defined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: The goal of the model is simply to predict the toxicity score of a model.** \n",
    "\n",
    "The bias weighted ROC metric below is calulated by taking segmenting the the dataset into identity subgroups by using the provided identity labels and then calculating the subgroup metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have trained some baseline models which we will use as a baseline to compare our neural network against. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to accuracy we will observe the below metrics for our models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall ROC-AUC:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard ROC-AUC for the full evaluation set. In other words this is the area under the Reciever Operating Characteristic curve. It compares the true positive and false positive rates of a binary model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subgroup ROC-AUC:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we restrict the data set to only the examples that mention the specific identity subgroup. A low value in this metric means the model does a poor job of distinguishing between toxic and non-toxic comments that mention the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BPSN AUC:\n",
    "\n",
    "BPSN (Background Positive, Subgroup Negative) AUC: Here, we restrict the test set to the non-toxic examples that mention the identity and the toxic examples that do not. A low value in this metric means that the model confuses non-toxic examples that mention the identity with toxic examples that do not, likely meaning that the model predicts higher toxicity scores than it should for non-toxic examples mentioning the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BNSP AUC:\n",
    "\n",
    "BNSP (Background Negative, Subgroup Positive) AUC: Here, we restrict the test set to the toxic examples that mention the identity and the non-toxic examples that do not. A low value here means that the model confuses toxic examples that mention the identity with non-toxic examples that do not, likely meaning that the model predicts lower toxicity scores than it should for toxic examples mentioning the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalized Mean of Bias AUCs\n",
    "To combine the per-identity Bias AUCs into one overall measure, we calculate their generalized mean as defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$M_p(m_s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{s=1}^{N} m_s^p\\right)^\\frac{1}{p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$M_p$ = the $p$th power-mean function\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_s$ = the bias metric $m$ calulated for subgroup $s$\n",
    "\n",
    "$N$ = number of identity subgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "For this competition, JigsawAI use a p value of -5 to encourage competitors to improve the model for the identity subgroups with the lowest model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Metric\n",
    "We combine the overall AUC with the generalized mean of the Bias AUCs to calculate the final model score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$score = w_0 AUC_{overall} + \\sum_{a=1}^{A} w_a M_p(m_{s,a})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$A$ = number of submetrics (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_{s,a}$ = bias metric for identity subgroup $s$ using submetric $a$\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_a$ = $a$ weighting for the relative importance of each submetric; all four $w$ values set to 0.25\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classical ML models\n",
    "This is primarily an NLP task, our X feature matrix will be based off the text from online comments. We have defined a pre-processing pipeline in the 'preprocessing.ipynb' notebook to use for our our ML classifiers and a seperate pre-processing pipeline for the neural network models we are planning on training.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the classic ML classifer models, we intend to use the following models - our base word embedding technique will be TF-IDF: \n",
    "\n",
    "   * Logistic Regression\n",
    "   * SVM\n",
    "   * Random Forest\n",
    " \n",
    "   \n",
    "We will carry out hyperparameter optimization for each model and calculate the metrics for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neural Networks\n",
    "*see NN_model.ipynb*\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also train a neural network to answer this problem. We will start with a basic LSTM model which will be made of:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * LSTM layers to read through the data\n",
    "   * Dense layers\n",
    "   * Output layer using sigmoid for the classes\n",
    "   \n",
    "We will then seek to improve this LSTM by creating a Bidrectional LSTM (BiLSTM) which we believe will improve accuracy by reading input sequences in both directions. If time allows we will also attempt to include a simple attention mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NN models will use Glove 840B 300d word embeddings. \n"

I worked in the public sector for 30 years in Eugene, often being the only black male in the office. I would not consider the vast majority of white folks I worked with to be conscious racists. However, the majority of them were ignorant about their own bias'. For example, they may say they hire people they feel comfortable with. However, since most of them never had a close black friend, they some how end up hiring only white folks. Of course, if they crew up in Idaho, how would they get to know any black people well enough to make friends? For example, I am the only black man to be a manager in the 100 year history of EWEB. For every one on those years EWEB was less than a mile from the UO. No one in management at EWEB think there is anything wrong or unusual with that reality. I would not be surprised if all public offices in Oregon have some degree of that blindness.\""

I despise that Wilson waged a war to allegedly make the world \"Safe for Democracy\" while black Americans were being segregated and being terrorized by white supremacist rioters and lynch mobs at home. I despise the racist DixieCrats who threw a tantrum over Fanny Lou Hamer\\'s Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference between me and you is that I acknowledge these to purge them from my current party. You do it to deflect from the segregationist president and his white nationalist buddies that you cape for here every day.'"

Others censor or ban anyone who upsets the apple cart by talking about sacred cows or elephants in the room: such as homosexuals and aids, or black crime, or overpaid civil servants,  Canadian Jews and Israel, or anything deemed politically incorrect. Of course it is okay to bash white Anglo saxon men or Muslims. But it is not okay to point out the  striking similarities between Orthodox Jews and Muslims and how they treat their women, or how a lot of Muslim men chase Christian and Jewish girls but we cant go near their girls. And it is not okay to talk about how only lower middle class Christian boys fight and die for Canada in te middle east wars while so many others hide out in elite schools. I wish some academics would address these issues objectively.'"
